The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

The try and catch keywords come in pairs:


MyCode{

    static Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    static boolean flag = true;
    static int B = input.nextInt();
    static int H = input.nextInt();

    static{
        try{
            if(B <= 0 || H <= 0){
                flag = false;
                throw new Exception("Breadth and height must be positive");
            }
        }catch(Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }

    }
}

output:
 2 3 = 6
          -3 4 =Breadth and height must be positive
